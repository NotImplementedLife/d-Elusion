DS game entry for Retro Platform Jam #3.

My first real attempt to create a Nintendo DS game.

# Description
A kitten has lost in the strange outside world. Help the poor kitten find the way back to its mother. Guide it through the map using a fish (the only stimulus the kitten responds to). Explore the zone and mark dangerous zones with flags. Use the arrow cursor to remove a misplaced flag. 

# Limitations

Saving progress works only on flashcard and is disabled in the emulator unless it's set up to emulate an R4 kernel or anything like that.

# Running on hardware
d-Elusion works just fine on a DSi with TwilightMenu++.
The game should work on R4 flashcards. If you have issues in launching it, try the -nosound version
